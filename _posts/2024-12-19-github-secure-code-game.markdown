While randomly surfing the Internet, I found an interesting repo from GitHub.
It's called [Secure Code Game](https://github.com/skills/secure-code-game).
I have tried the first level from the first season. It's quite interesting.
It was about _underflow_ bug. We've heard more about overflow.

I'll try fo find time to work on other levels.
