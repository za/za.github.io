After almost [two months](https://tw.pycon.org/2014apac/en/), finally [the PyCon APAC 2014 videos](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHLnNgRnfGYDzPCCH8qGbQw) have been released! *(actually it has been uploaded two weeks ago)* 

![PyCon APAC 2014 Video](/images/pyconapac2014-video.png) 

It was my first PyCon and also it was my first time experience [speaking at PyCon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMxiKcgoWZo). I shared my experience on using Python to perform [application security testing](https://speakerdeck.com/za/python-for-application-security-testing). 

However I still couldn't find the [keynote speaker](https://tw.pycon.org/2014apac/en/program/keynote-speakers/) videos available online. Tracks that I attended and already available online are: [A. Jesse Jiryu Davis](http://emptysqua.re/blog/pycon-apac-2014-recap/) [talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOKcZjI5zME), [Social Network Analysis with Python](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=259sgRMHso0), [Statistics in Python with R](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzVvZ9HPrn8). I remembered I was sitting in front of R3 room at A. Jesse Jiryu Davis's talk hence there were so many attendess. That's why I could take a great shot from where I sat.

It's very nice to meet so many people who share the same interest. It was a very great experience for me, for being one in six-hundreds Pythonistas. Even, the Taiwan Pythonistas are very kind and generous. [Jack Tsai](http://twitter.com/jacksctsai) allowed me to stay at his place for one night in Hsinchu by the time I arrived at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport.  

I believe in a *circle*. We must be in a right circle to help us improve our self. That's why I try consistently organizing a bimonthly [Python Indonesia](http://python.or.id) [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Python-ID/). We haven't had six-hundreds Pythonistas yet. Having our own [PyCon Indonesia](https://twitter.com/pyconid) sure it's still a long way to go. But we believe with this small meetup it will make a difference in the future, as long we can keep it consistent.

Last words. Sure, I realize still need to learn and practice more about Python. And ... thank you for the PyCon APAC 2014 organizer for organizing such a great events. Thank you Jack Tsai for the hospitality. Thank you Tzer-jen Wei for taking me to Hualien and have [rafting at Xiuguluan River](http://za.github.io/2014/06/13/xiuguluan-river/). Thank you Fernando Perez and Andreas Klockner for a wonderful time spent with.
